## Who are we?




_Kontra klasa_ is a Marxist collective based primarily in Zagreb, with comrades and sympathizers in other parts of Croatia and the region. It came to existence as a result of several months of discussions in which people from all over the left (socialist) part of the political spectrum took part. The name itself – Kontra klasa – has two meanings. On the one hand, it describes our stance towards the current social order; we are against class division in society and against the existence of classes in general. The other meaning of our name, which might be more obvious if we write the word together, Kontraklasa, is based on the role of the working class in capitalism, or rather in the process of its abolition. Workers, the modern proletariat, are a class whose interests are opposed to those of capital and as such it holds the potential for its toppling; the working class is, due to its position in society, always placed against the rule of capital, it's the _counter-class_.





## What are our activities?




Since our organization is rather young, for now our activities are limited to theoretical work on our magazine which we plan to publish several times a year, or as often as we will be able to, depending on circumstances. Editions of our magazine will primarily be focused on a specific subject (for example, precarious work, organizing of workers and socialists, etc.), which will be elaborated in greater detail than subjects dealt with in our sporadically published website articles. Except for the magazine, our website contains translations of foreign articles, current events' analyses (strikes, protests and political events, for example) and theoretical works. We hold that a "critique of everything" is an important element of current socialist activity, because of the existence of many wrong approaches to revolutionary activity and society as a whole, caused partly by ignorance, and partly by traditional adherence to certain schools of the socialist movement. Our goal is to replace dogmatism with discussion.




We hope to develop a practical function along with the present "virtual" one, which would be devoid of all leftism's pitfalls; that means that we do not plan to engage in useless media performances, but to work in accordance with objective social circumstances as well as with our own. At the moment, we are participating in theoretical discussions held in Zagreb, from which our group had emerged. We plan to continue holding them, and we invite everyone with a basic socialist outlook to join us in them. As far as our future activities go, we are still discussing their possibilities, which will be defined and developed through our joint experiences.





## Where do we stand?




In the end, there still remains the question of our basic positions. Although we collectively reject commitment to any socialist tendency or current (except for the basic ones – Marxism and communism), we still hold certain positions which create a pathway to our present and future activities.






 	
  1. **Internationalism** – we oppose nationalism in every shape or form – since capital is present globally, the working class needs to make connections on a global scale. With this we oppose various racist and nativist movements in present society. The purpose of nationalism is to weaken the power of the working class, present  domestic capitalists as our allies and foreign workers as our enemies.  With adherence to internationalism, we support fights against every form of discrimination within the working class, such as misogyny, homophobia, transphobia, religious discrimination, etc.

 	
  2. **Antiparliamentarism** – Since the time of 2nd International (the end of the 19th century), socialist movements were engaged in parliamentary participation, with the intention of seizing power or using inter – parliament institutions and discussions for propaganda purposes. More than a century later, it is fairly obvious that this strategy is completely amiss. We don't even have to travel into the past to see this – the example of Syriza is telling enough -  it came to power with promises of socialist reforms and ended up a classical party of the liberal right. With less and less people voting, which is an obvious sign of progressive rejection or parliamentarism by the working class, potential socialist propaganda within Parliament would even be counterproductive. Socialism can't be achieved through formation of nominally socialist governments and dead end reforms, but only through the workers' revolutionary initiative for the socioeconomic transformation of the social system as a whole.

 	
  3. **Unions** – With their beginnings in the age of industrial capitalism, unions had a role of fighting for workers' rights in the past. The progressivness of this role was, however, replaced by the potential of socialist revolution in times which allowed it. It is hard to pinpoint the moment in which unions lost their progressiveness, but we can certainly identify this loss today. Nowadays unions are more likely to smother workers' initiatives by siding with the law and instisting on making compromises with capital in order to preserve „social peace“. Does this mean, however, as some socialist currents suggest, that interworking with the unions is out of the question? No. Unions can still enable a sense of security, especially on a personal level. Nevertheless, we as communists consider our duty to advocate for workers' interests even though it may result in clashes with union management and even expulsion from the union. The unions are not potentially revolutionary organizations, their purpose is to maintain the status quo.

 	
  4. **Rejection of "real socialism"** – the socialist/communist movement has yet to fully free itself from the imprints of official ideological currents of so called "real socialism" which characterised the East block countries. Since the Russian revolution of 1917 and especially Stalin's dictatorship in the Soviet union (from the 1930's, onward), socialist and communist groups have uncritically supported these countries. This trend somewhat continues to this day, taking shape in leftism's defense of crimes committed in Stalinist regimes, and of maintaining yugonostalgic sentiments in the Croatian and wider Balkan context. Our position regarding these regimes is that neither of them represented a form of worker's state, let alone socialism or communism. They were systems with class divisions within which the working class was still exploited, including the present systems, like that in North Korea. For this reason, these systems are not worthy of our support. Discussion about their economic structure is still ongoing within our collective and probably will remain that way for a period of time.




These positions are only some among many, presented in a rather short and crude way. Detailed explanations of these positions as well as analyses of other questions regarding present socialist and workers activities will be delivered in our magazine articles and theoretical works published on our website.
